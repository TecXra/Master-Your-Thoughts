Here at Master Your Thoughts Boot Camp we believe that people are moving away from a place where they work for others to one of self-employment. We believe that if most people move towards Entrepreneurship whole systems will change and shift to accommodate this type of movement, and It will benefit people everywhere. Those who do not choose to move towards self-employment will also have much more than they have now because they will be in higher demand. That would allow for all to flourish, and change the situation of the majority of the wealth being in the hands of the top 1% of people.
